# PacPeople-Ghost-Party
A browser based program that allows users to add ghosts from the game PacMan to their screen. Sprites will then bounce around and have a party all over your desktop.

Users can utilize HTML buttons to add additional ghost sprites to bounce around their desktop browser. 

In the future, I hope to make the sprites moveable with either the users cursor or arrow keys.
